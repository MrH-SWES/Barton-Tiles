# Audio File Organization for Barton Tiles

This document maps audio files to their corresponding tiles and categories in the Reading Tile Board application.

## File Organization Structure

All audio files should be placed in the `/audio` directory. Files are organized by phonetic category to match the tile system.

## Implementation Notes

1. **File Naming Convention**: All files use lowercase letters with hyphens separating the phoneme from example words
2. **Multiple Representations**: Some sounds can be spelled different ways (e.g., long "o" can be "o_e", "oa", or "oe")
3. **Context-Dependent Sounds**: Some tiles (like "th") have multiple audio files for different pronunciations

## Usage in Application

Audio files should be played when:
- A tile is clicked/tapped (preview sound)
- A tile is placed in the word pane (optional)
- A completed word is tapped (read the whole word - future feature)

## File Placement

Place all `.mp3` files directly in the `/audio` directory:
```
/audio/
  ├── a-apple.mp3
  ├── a-cake.mp3
  ├── air-pair-share.mp3
  └── ... (all other files)
```
